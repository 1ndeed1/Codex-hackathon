I know the theory part. Like if someone asks me a verbal question about React or NodeJS or Spring boot....I don't wanna list all the things🫠 \n\nYeah so i know what they are, what they do and how they work. I'm just not able to put in practical. Like whenever I try to code something, i straight up go to gpt or something and ask how to do it. \n\nI wanna build stuff from scratch! Not just review the over complicated code given by an AI.\n\nPLEASE HELP!...",
